# Carve a jack-o-lantern in R

I made this package partly for fun (who doesn't want to draw a jack-o-lantern in R?) and partly as a simple example of how to write a package. I added the face image to my drawing last year (2022) and cleaned it up this year (2023) when I converted my drawing to a package. I also added a cat this year, so your pumpkins can have some variety. Maybe I'll add omething else next year.

Feel free to download and use it and let me know how it works for you.
